# Fingerprint-presentation-attack-detection
This thesis aims to propose fingerprint PAD methods based on deep learning techniques. The aim is to improve the generalization performance of fingerprint PAD systems against spoofs acquired with unknown sensors or made from materials not seen during training. In particular, this thesis presents two main contributions through two approaches. The first approach is based on a classification backbone coupled with generative adversarial networks (GAN) for solving the problem of multi-target domain adaptation in a one-to-one mapping manner. While the second approach uses a unified GAN model for multi-domain conversion to jointly learn several mappings between all domains.

This project was submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of master of science in the department of computer engineering at the college of computer and information sciences - King Saud University.
